# sqalchemy-challenge

This challenge consists of two parts.
1. Light data analysis in climate_starter.ipynb
2. Development of an API based on weather data from Hawaii in app.py

## Data Analysis
* Chart showing total rainfall across the data set for the last year of data. 
* Summary statistics of the precipitation data.
* Calculation of the most active weather stations (all stations ranked by number of data points in the data set.)
* Histogram of the last 12 months of temperature data. 

## Climate API
* Landing page with menu for routes and syntax.
* 5 routes available:
    * Precipitation
    * Stations
    * Temperatures
    * Min, max, and average temperatures based on user-provided start date
    * Min, max, and average temperatures based on user-provided date range
